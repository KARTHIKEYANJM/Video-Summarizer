algorithmspreparing for data structures algorithms  preparing for data structures algorithms coding interviews or computativecoding interviews or computative  coding interviews or computative programming i know that it's very tiringprogramming i know that it's very tiring  programming i know that it's very tiring and the journey is longand the journey is long  and the journey is long so a lot of people are very demotivatedso a lot of people are very demotivated  so a lot of people are very demotivated oror  or they constantly ask this question thatthey constantly ask this question that  they constantly ask this question that how long would it take them to behow long would it take them to be  how long would it take them to be really good at it or reach that stepreally good at it or reach that step  really good at it or reach that step wherein they can confidently say thatwherein they can confidently say that  wherein they can confidently say that they can crack coding interviews sothey can crack coding interviews so  they can crack coding interviews so that's exactly what we are going to talkthat's exactly what we are going to talk  that's exactly what we are going to talk about today i will be sharing my journeyabout today i will be sharing my journey  about today i will be sharing my journey what it looked like and how long did itwhat it looked like and how long did it  what it looked like and how long did it take me to be really good at datatake me to be really good at data  take me to be really good at data structures and algorithmsstructures and algorithms  structures and algorithms so i really hope that a lot of you guysso i really hope that a lot of you guys  so i really hope that a lot of you guys who are studying data centers algorithmswho are studying data centers algorithms  who are studying data centers algorithms or preparing for coding interviews oror preparing for coding interviews or  or preparing for coding interviews or even doing competitive programmingeven doing competitive programming  even doing competitive programming i really hope you guys can relate to iti really hope you guys can relate to it  i really hope you guys can relate to it and get inspired at the same timeand get inspired at the same time  and get inspired at the same time now an important question to ask overnow an important question to ask over  now an important question to ask over here ishere is  here is how good you are at data structures andhow good you are at data structures and  how good you are at data structures and algorithms and how do you measure thatalgorithms and how do you measure that  algorithms and how do you measure that we do not want a binary answer over herewe do not want a binary answer over here  we do not want a binary answer over here we want to measurewe want to measure  we want to measure how good we are and i have seen that ifhow good we are and i have seen that if  how good we are and i have seen that if you areyou are  you are active on code forces or code chef theyactive on code forces or code chef they  active on code forces or code chef they are good toolsare good tools  are good tools because they provide you a rating whichbecause they provide you a rating which  because they provide you a rating which is nothing butis nothing but  is nothing but a measure of how good you can performa measure of how good you can perform  a measure of how good you can perform how good you can really solve problemshow good you can really solve problems  how good you can really solve problems and at the same time how well you are inand at the same time how well you are in  and at the same time how well you are in debugging as well as writingdebugging as well as writing  debugging as well as writing bug-less code and that's exactly how ibug-less code and that's exactly how i  bug-less code and that's exactly how i used to judgeused to judge  used to judge my skills as well that's exactly how imy skills as well that's exactly how i  my skills as well that's exactly how i even used to motivate myself that i wanteven used to motivate myself that i want  even used to motivate myself that i want to achieve this much rating on codeto achieve this much rating on code  to achieve this much rating on code forces and it became easy because iforces and it became easy because i  forces and it became easy because i could set a target and i could clearlycould set a target and i could clearly  could set a target and i could clearly see whether i am meeting that or not     so this is how my story looks like andso this is how my story looks like and  so this is how my story looks like and i'm from electrical engineering so iti'm from electrical engineering so it  i'm from electrical engineering so it took me a bit timetook me a bit time  took me a bit time to get started with competitiveto get started with competitive  to get started with competitive programming i started in fourth semesterprogramming i started in fourth semester  programming i started in fourth semester which is kind of late for me i mean iwhich is kind of late for me i mean i  which is kind of late for me i mean i know that there are so many peopleknow that there are so many people  know that there are so many people out there who have not even doneout there who have not even done  out there who have not even done competitive programming and they havecompetitive programming and they have  competitive programming and they have already graduated from collegealready graduated from college  already graduated from college but the point that i'm trying to make isbut the point that i'm trying to make is  but the point that i'm trying to make is there is a lot of awareness these daysthere is a lot of awareness these days  there is a lot of awareness these days and i'm very happy to see that a lot ofand i'm very happy to see that a lot of  and i'm very happy to see that a lot of students start competitive programmingstudents start competitive programming  students start competitive programming from their first year itself which isfrom their first year itself which is  from their first year itself which is so awesome to hear but when i startedso awesome to hear but when i started  so awesome to hear but when i started with that i meanwith that i mean  with that i mean there were only a handful of people fromthere were only a handful of people from  there were only a handful of people from my branch who used to do itmy branch who used to do it  my branch who used to do it and when i tried to seek help or askand when i tried to seek help or ask  and when i tried to seek help or ask advice from students who are really goodadvice from students who are really good  advice from students who are really good at itat it  at it they were from computer sciencethey were from computer science  they were from computer science background i didn't feel very good ibackground i didn't feel very good i  background i didn't feel very good i actually felt insulted and they wereactually felt insulted and they were  actually felt insulted and they were just tossing me around here and therejust tossing me around here and there  just tossing me around here and there and they were really not interested inand they were really not interested in  and they were really not interested in solving my doubts sosolving my doubts so  solving my doubts so i kind of felt a bit insulted andi kind of felt a bit insulted and  i kind of felt a bit insulted and demotivated that you are tryingdemotivated that you are trying  demotivated that you are trying something out butsomething out but  something out but you cannot get that help so i know howyou cannot get that help so i know how  you cannot get that help so i know how that feels and i had been therethat feels and i had been there  that feels and i had been there the first notable moment that happenedthe first notable moment that happened  the first notable moment that happened in my career wasin my career was  in my career was when it was around six months that i hadwhen it was around six months that i had  when it was around six months that i had started doing competitive programmingstarted doing competitive programming  started doing competitive programming and i secured a world rank of 25 in oneand i secured a world rank of 25 in one  and i secured a world rank of 25 in one of the code chef long challengesof the code chef long challenges  of the code chef long challenges which span across 10 days and you havewhich span across 10 days and you have  which span across 10 days and you have to solve 10 competitive programmingto solve 10 competitive programming  to solve 10 competitive programming problemsproblems  problems i really felt good i solved nine and ai really felt good i solved nine and a  i really felt good i solved nine and a half problems in that so it washalf problems in that so it was  half problems in that so it was quite awesome for me to do that and inquite awesome for me to do that and in  quite awesome for me to do that and in those six months ithose six months i  those six months i really worked super hard to improve myreally worked super hard to improve my  really worked super hard to improve my skills in data structures and algorithmsskills in data structures and algorithms  skills in data structures and algorithms and just to give you an example iand just to give you an example i  and just to give you an example i learned segmentaries which sounds like alearned segmentaries which sounds like a  learned segmentaries which sounds like a complex data structure but it's reallycomplex data structure but it's really  complex data structure but it's really notnot  not but i learned that in the second monthbut i learned that in the second month  but i learned that in the second month itself of starting my journey towardsitself of starting my journey

while i'm taking a bath or probably i'm justi'm taking a bath or probably i'm just  i'm taking a bath or probably i'm just walking to my lecturewalking to my lecture  walking to my lecture or probably if i'm not interested inor probably if i'm not interested in  or probably if i'm not interested in what the lecture is teachingwhat the lecture is teaching  what the lecture is teaching i used to think about the problem that ii used to think about the problem that i  i used to think about the problem that i couldn't solve and i used to startcouldn't solve and i used to start  couldn't solve and i used to start thinking like how i should approach itthinking like how i should approach it  thinking like how i should approach it so that i can solve it so i used to doso that i can solve it so i used to do  so that i can solve it so i used to do all those things myall those things my  all those things my normal day would look something likenormal day would look something like  normal day would look something like that i almost used to code aroundthat i almost used to code around  that i almost used to code around three hours on average on tough days ithree hours on average on tough days i  three hours on average on tough days i used to also code for aroundused to also code for around  used to also code for around eight or nine hours and when there wereeight or nine hours and when there were  eight or nine hours and when there were contests goingcontests going  contests going on i remember that i used to stay awakeon i remember that i used to stay awake  on i remember that i used to stay awake at six a.mat six a.m  at six a.m trying to solve problems but you know ittrying to solve problems but you know it  trying to solve problems but you know it really gotreally got  really got addictive to me because the results wereaddictive to me because the results were  addictive to me because the results were magnificent i could see that within twomagnificent i could see that within two  magnificent i could see that within two three months i'm performingthree months i'm performing  three months i'm performing so damn good that you know i gotso damn good that you know i got  so damn good that you know i got addicted to it it was so damn cool foraddicted to it it was so damn cool for  addicted to it it was so damn cool for me to see thatme to see that  me to see that i'm able to solve so many problems thati'm able to solve so many problems that  i'm able to solve so many problems that i couldn't even starti couldn't even start  i couldn't even start to think

those six months i learned a lot andin those six months i learned a lot and  in those six months i learned a lot and i realized that you should definitelyi realized that you should definitely  i realized that you should definitely celebrate your small ones like if youcelebrate your small ones like if you  celebrate your small ones like if you are not able to solve some problemare not able to

you are never backed down by the demotivation and the negativitydemotivation and the negativity  demotivation and the negativity which comes in everybody's life     now i want to talk about those thingsnow i want to talk about those things  now i want to talk about those things which really helped me grow a lotwhich really helped me grow a lot  which really helped me grow a lot in such a short amount of time i alwaysin such a short amount of time i always  in such a short amount of time i always made sure that i'm solving at least onemade sure that i'm solving at least one  made sure that i'm solving at least one or two problemsor two problems  or two problems which i couldn't solve during thewhich i couldn't solve during the  which i couldn't solve during the contest and in doing that that's how icontest and in doing that that's how i  contest and in doing that that's how i learned segmentaries in the second monthlearned segmentaries in the second month  learned segmentaries in the second month itself of my journeyitself of my journey  itself of my journey so this way i developed the ability toso this way i developed the ability to  so this way i developed the ability to read tutorialsread tutorials  read tutorials and understand and learn new things so iand understand and learn new things so i  and understand and learn new things so i require new learnings into my mindrequire new learnings into my mind  require new learnings into my mind so that's one very important skill whichso that's one very important skill which  so that's one very important skill which i developed and using thati developed and using that  i developed and using that i made sure that i'm learning new topicsi made sure that i'm learning new topics  i made sure that i'm learning new topics so i learned segment trees i learnedso i learned segment trees i learned  so i learned segment trees i learned fenwick trees i learned dynamicfenwick trees i learned dynamic  fenwick trees i learned dynamic programmingprogramming  programming so all this happened just because i wasso all this happened just because i was  so all this happened just because i was doing contestsdoing contests  doing contests actively and i was also doing up solvingactively and i was also doing up solving  actively and i was also doing up solving actively which meansactively which means  actively which means solving those problems which you weresolving those problems which you were  solving those problems which you were not able to solvenot able to solve  not able to solve during the contest and doing that forduring the contest and doing that for  during the contest and doing that for six monthssix months  six months you i was so amazed to see that i meanyou i was so amazed to see that i mean  you i was so amazed to see that i mean getting a world rank of 25 in such agetting a world rank of 25 in such a  getting a world rank of 25 in such a short amount of time was ashort amount of time was a  short amount of time was a very huge deal for me and you can't evenvery huge deal for me and you can't even  very huge deal for me and you can't even imagine the amount of motivation itimagine the amount of motivation it  imagine the amount of motivation it gives you backgives you back  gives you back when you see such great results sowhen you see such great results so  when you see such great results so that's exactly what i want to emphasizethat's exactly what i want to emphasize  that's exactly what i want to emphasize uponupon  upon you should definitely be doing hard workyou should definitely be doing hard work  you should definitely be doing hard work but also do those things correctlybut also do those things correctly  but also do those things correctly solve those problems which you are notsolve those problems which you are not  solve those problems which you are not able to solve in the first placeable to solve in the first place  able to solve in the first place and doing that like i am pretty muchand doing that like i am pretty much  and doing that like i am pretty much sure that if you do it for a period ofsure that if you do it for a period of  sure that if you do it for a period of three or four monthsthree or four months  three or four months the results will be incredible guys     the other good thing which worked to mythe other good thing which worked to my  the other good thing which worked to my advantage was that i started from zeroadvantage was that i started from zero  advantage was that i started from zero right so when you're starting withright so when you're starting with  right so when you're starting with absolute zero you haveabsolute zero you have  absolute zero you have so much to learn so quickly that itso much to learn so quickly that it  so much to learn so quickly that it really feels good that you're learningreally feels good that you're learning  really feels good that you're learning so many thingsso many things  so many things because you didn't know so many thingsbecause you didn't know so many things  because you didn't know so many things so it's very easy for you to learn inso it's very easy for you to learn in  so it's very easy for you to learn in the initial periodthe initial period  the initial period and that's something which i would askand that's something which i would ask  and that's something which i would ask you to take advantage ofyou to take advantage of  you to take advantage of like don't feel that we don't know solike don't feel that we don't know so  like don't feel that we don't know so many things think about itmany things think about it  many things think about it you can learn so many things in such ayou can learn so many things in such a  you can learn so many things in such a short amount of timeshort amount of time  short amount of time now after six months i decided to alsonow after six months i decided to also  now after six months i decided to also switch to code forcesswitch to code forces  switch to code forces on which there are many short contestson which there are many short contests  on which there are many short contests which are held likewhich are held like  which are held like like a contest on code forces would havelike a contest on code forces would have  like a contest on code forces would have four or five problemsfour or five problems  four or five problems and you will be asked to solve them inand you will be asked to solve them in  and you will be asked to solve them in two and a half hours or two hourstwo and a half hours or two hours  two and a half hours or two hours so in this situation i realized that ohso in this situation i realized that oh  so in this situation i realized that oh my god i am a terrible problem solvermy god i am a terrible problem solver  my god i am a terrible problem solver why becausewhy because  why because the courtship long challenges were forthe courtship long challenges were for  the courtship long challenges were for 10 days and i had so much amount of time10 days and i had so much amount of time  10 days and i had so much amount of time and one thing which i have realized isand one thing which i have realized is  and one thing which i have realized is that when you are uncomfortablethat when you are uncomfortable  that when you are uncomfortable solving some problem you tend tosolving some problem you tend to  solving some problem you tend to postpone it or get away with it okaypostpone it or get away with it okay  postpone it or get away with it okay and that's exactly what i used to doand that's exactly what i used to do  and that's exactly what i used to do like when i'm giving a code for thislike when i'm giving a code for this  like when i'm giving a code for this problem and i'm trying to solve aproblem and i'm trying to solve a  problem and i'm trying to solve a problem whichproblem which  problem which is kind of tricky to solve for me iis kind of tricky to solve for me i  is kind of tricky to solve for me i would feelwould feel  would feel so lazy to solve it you know what i'mso lazy to solve it you know what i'm  so lazy to solve it you know what i'm trying to saytrying to say  trying to say like my mind was trained to postponelike my mind was trained to postpone  like my mind was trained to postpone things where i'm feeling uncomfortablethings where i'm feeling uncomfortable  things where i'm feeling uncomfortable and probably pick them up later when i'mand probably pick them up later when i'm  and probably pick them up later when i'm having a walk or in my leisure time sohaving a walk or in my leisure time so  having a walk or in my leisure time so that's the attitude which i developedthat's the attitude which i developed  that's the attitude which i developed whilewhile  while doing the courtship long challengesdoing the courtship long challenges  doing the courtship long challenges because they were for 10 days long so ibecause they were for 10 days long so i  because they were for 10 days long so i couldcould  could deal with them like very easily in adeal with them like very easily in a  deal with them like very easily in a very comfortable amount of timevery comfortable amount of time  very comfortable amount of time but this is where code forces completelybut this is where code forces completely  but this is where code forces completely turned the picture like iturned the picture like i  turned the picture like i did really very bad in the initial fewdid really very bad in the initial few  did really very bad in the initial few contests just because i was gettingcontests just because i was getting  contests just because i was getting accustomed to the portal as well asaccustomed to the portal as well as  accustomed to the portal as well as the new like the faster way of solvingthe new like the faster way of solving  the new like the faster way of solving problems which i was really not good atproblems which i was really not good at  problems which i was really not good at at that point of timeat that point of time  at that point of time so i had the skills to solve problemsso i had the skills to solve problems  so i had the skills to solve problems but i was not quick enough that's whatbut i was not quick enough that's what  but i was not quick enough that's what i'm trying to sayi'm trying to say  i'm trying to say and that's some skill which really tookand that's some skill which really took  and that's some skill which really took me a lot of time to develop over theme a lot of time to develop over the  me a lot of time to develop over the period of timeperiod of time  period of time and that's where code forces helped meand that's where code forces helped me  and that's where code forces helped me really a lot     so i kept on giving contests they wereso i kept on giving contests they were  so i kept on giving contests they were always ups and downs in few contests i'malways ups and downs in few contests i'm  always ups and downs in few contests i'm doing really good in some contests i'mdoing really good in some contests i'm  doing really good in some contests i'm not doingnot doing  not doing that good i'm making the mistakes thethat good i'm making the mistakes the  that good i'm making the mistakes the ones which i just mentioned few minutesones which i just mentioned few minutes  ones which i just mentioned few minutes backback  back so overall this continued for a periodso overall this continued for a period  so overall this continued for a period of around 10of around 10  of around 10 11 months or one year you can say11 months or one year you can say  11 months or one year you can say roughly one yearroughly one year  roughly one year and now it's been around one year and aand now it's been around one year and a  and now it's been around one year and a halfhalf  half so in these 18 months i reached thatso in these 18 months i reached that  so in these 18 months i reached that point where i was super confident aboutpoint where i was super confident about  point where i was super confident about my data structure and algorithm skills imy data structure and algorithm skills i  my data structure and algorithm skills i knew why my approach is right or why isknew why my approach is right or why is  knew why my approach is right or why is it wrongit wrong  it wrong and i only started writing the code whenand i only started writing the code when  and i only started writing the code when i was sure that this is correcti was sure that this is correct  i was sure that this is correct and more importantly having the skill isand more importantly having the skill is  and more importantly having the skill is good but more important in that isgood but more important in that is  good but more important in that is i was really very quick in navigatingi was really very quick in navigating  i was really very quick in navigating the multiple solutions and also pickingthe multiple solutions and also picking  the multiple solutions and also picking up the most optimized one which is atup the most optimized one which is at  up the most optimized one which is at the same time correctthe same time correct  the same time correct right we don't want optimized solutionsright we don't want optimized solutions  right we don't want optimized solutions which are wrong sowhich are wrong so  which are wrong so developing the skill to think aboutdeveloping the skill to think about  developing the skill to think about multiple solutions figure out which onemultiple solutions figure out which one  multiple solutions figure out which one is right which one is wrongis right which one is wrong  is right which one is wrong and why it's wrong having all thoseand why it's wrong having all those  and why it's wrong having all those things in mind and doing thatthings in mind and doing that  things in mind and doing that quickly is a very important skill whichquickly is a very important skill which  quickly is a very important skill which took me around 18 months totook me around 18
