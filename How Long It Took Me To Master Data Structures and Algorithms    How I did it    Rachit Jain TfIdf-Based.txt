computative  coding interviews or computative programmingthe journey is longand the journey is long  and the journey is long so a lot of people are very demotivatedso a lot of people are very demotivated  or they constantly ask this question thatthey constantly ask this question that  they constantly ask this question that how long would it take them to behow long would it take them to be  how long would it take them to be really good at it or reach that stepreally good at it or reach that step  really good at it or reach that stepwherein they can confidently say thatwherein they can confidently say that  wherein they can confidently say that they can crack coding interviews sothey can crack coding interviewsthat's exactly what we are going to talk about todayi will be sharing my journey what it looked like and how long did itwhat it looked like and how long did it  what it looked like and how long did it take me to be really good at datataketake me to be really good at data structures and algorithmsstructures and algorithms  structures and algorithmsso i really hope that a lot of you guys who are studying data centers algorithmswho are studying data centers algorithms  who are studying data centers algorithms or preparing for coding interviews oror preparing for coding interviews or  or preparing for coding interviews or even doing competitive programmingeven doing competitive programming  even doing competitive programmingi really hope you guys can relate to itii really hope you guys can relate to it and get inspired at the same timeandget inspired at the same time  and get inspired at the same time now an important question to ask overnow an important question to ask over  now an important question to ask over here ishereandhow good you are at data structures and  how good you are at data structures and algorithms and how do you measure thatalgorithms and how do you measure that  algorithms andhow do you measure that we do not want a binary answer over herewe do not want a binary answer over here  you are active on code forces or code chef theyactive on code forces or code chefare good tools because they provide you a rating whichbecause they provide you a rating which  because they provide you a rating which is nothing butis nothingbut  is nothing but a measure of how good you can performa measure of how good you can perform  a measure of how good you can perform how good you can really solve problemshow goodhow good you can really solve problems and at the same time how well you are inand at the same timeat the same time how well you are in debugging as well as writingdebugging as well as writing  debugging as well as writing bug-less codeand that's exactly how i used to judgeused to judge  used to judge my skills as wellthat's exactly how i even used to motivate myself that i wanteven used to motivate myself that i want  even used to motivate myself that i want to achieve this much rating on codetoachieve this much rating on code  to achieve this much rating on code forces and it became easy because iforces and it became easy because i  forces and it became easy because i could set a targettook me a bit time to get started with competitiveto get started with competitive  to get started with competitive programmingi started in fourth semester which is kind of late for meknow that there are so many people out there who have not even doneout there who have not even done  out there who have not even done competitive programming and they havecompetitive programming and they have  competitive programmingalready graduated from college but the point that i'm trying to makethe point that i'm trying to make is there is a lot of awarenessand i'm very happy to see that a lot of students start competitive programmingstudentsstudents start competitive programming from their first year itself which isfrom their first year itself which is  from their first year itself which is so awesome to hearbut when i startedso awesome to hear but when i started  so awesome to hear but when i started with that i meanwith thatfromthere were only a handful of people from  there were only a handful of people from my branch who used to do itmy branch who used to do it  my branch who used to do it and when i tried to seek help or askand when i tried to seek help or ask  and when i tried to seek help or ask advice from students who are really goodadvice from students who are really good  advice from students who are really good at itat it  at iti actually felt insulted and they wereactually felt insulted and they were  actually felt insulted and they were just tossing me around here and therejust tossing me around herea bit insulted andi kind of felt a bit insultedand  i kind of felt a bit insulted and demotivated that you are tryingdemotivated that you are trying  demotivated that you are trying something out butsomething outand i had been there the first notable moment that happenedthe first notable moment that happened  the first notable moment that happened in my career wasinit was around six months that i had  when it was around six months that i had started doing competitive programmingstarted doing competitive programming  started doing competitive programmingand i secured a world rank of 25 in one of the code cheflong challengesof the code chef long challenges  of the code chef long challenges which span across 10 daysand you have to solve 10 competitive programmingto solve 10 competitive programming  to solve 10 competitive programming problemsproblems  problems i really felt goodthose six months i really worked super hard to improve myreally worked super hard to improve my  really worked super hard to improve my skills in data structures and algorithmsskills in data structures and algorithms  skills in data structures and algorithms and just to give you an example iand just to give you an examplei  and just to give you an example i learned segmentaries which sounds like alearned segmentaries which sounds like a  learned segmentaries which sounds like a complex data structurebut it's really  complex data structurebut i learned that in the second monthbut i learned that in the second month  but i learned that in the second month itself of starting my journey towardsitself of starting my journey towards  itself of starting my journey towards data structures and algorithmsdata structures and algorithms  data structures and algorithmsit was a daily routine for me to read competitive programming problemscompetitive programming problems  competitive programming problems and think about their situationswhileand think about their situations while  and think about their situations while i'm taking a bath orprobably i'm justi'm taking a bath orprobably i'm just walking to my lecturewalking to my lecture  walking to my lecture or probably if i'm not interested inor probably if i'm not interested in  or probably if i'm not interested in what the lecture is teachingwhat the lecture is teaching  what the lecture is teaching i used to think about the problem that ii used to think about the problem that i  i used to think about the problem that i couldn't solve and i used to startcouldn't solve and i used to start  couldn't solve and i used to start thinking like how i should approach itthinking like how i should approach it  thinking like how i should approach it so that i can solve itmy  all those things my normal day would look something likenormal day would look something like  normal day would look something like that i almost used to code aroundthat i almost used to code around  that i almost used to code around three hours on average on tough days ithree hours on average on tough daysi  three hours on average on tough days i used to also code for aroundused to also code for around  used to also code for around eight or nine hours and when there wereeight or nine hoursi remember that i used to stay awake at six a.mat sixit really gotreally got  really got addictive to me because the results wereaddictive to me because the results were  addictive to me because the results were magnificenti could see that within twomagnificent i could see that within two  magnificent i could see that within two three months i'm performingthree monthsi'm performing so damn good that you know i gotso damn goodit was so damn cool for me to see thatme to see that  me to see that i'm able to solve so many problemsthati'm able to solve so many problems that  i'm able to solve so many problems that i couldn't even starti couldn't even start  i couldn't even start to think how to solve themso seeingto think how to solve them so seeing  to think how to solve them so seeing that improvementthat improvement  that improvement to even practice more and give more ofto even practice more and give more of  to even practice more and give more of my inputs and that's how it worked formy inputs and that's how it worked for  my inputsin those six months i learned a lot and i realized that you should definitelyi realized that you should definitely  i realized that you should definitely celebrate your small ones like if youcelebrate your small oneslike if you  celebrate your small ones like if you are not able to solve some problemare not able to solve some problem  are not able to solve some problem initially but now you are able to solveinitiallythat now you learn  should be happy that now you learn dynamic programmingdynamic programming  dynamic programming that now if there is a problem coming onthat now if there is a problem coming on  that now if there is a problem coming on bp or dynamic programmingbp or dynamic programming  bp or dynamic programming now you are able to approach it nowso those things really push you or giveso those things really push you or give  so those things really push you or give you confidence to put in more of youryou confidence to put in more of your  and that's how you have to create your own positivity and momentumown positivity and momentum  own positivity and momentum so that you are never backed down by theso that you are never backed down by the  so that you are never backed down by the demotivation and the negativitydemotivation and the negativity  demotivation and the negativity which comes in everybody's life     now i want to talk about those things which really helped me grow a lotwhich really helped me grow a lot  which really helped me grow a lot in such a short amount of time i alwaysin such a short amount of time i always  in such a short amount of time i always made sure that i'm solvingat least onemade sure that i'm solving at least one  made sure that i'm solving at least one or two problemsor two problems  or two problems which i couldn't solve during thewhichi couldn't solve during the  which i couldn't solve during the contest and in doingthat that's how i learned segmentaries in the second monthlearned segmentaries in the second month  learned segmentaries in the second month itself of my journeyitself of my journey  itself of my journeyso this way i developed the ability to read tutorialsread tutorials  read tutorials and understand and learn new things so iand understand and learn new thingsso i require new learnings into my mindrequire new learnings into my mind  require new learnings into my mindso that's one very important skill which i developed and using thati developed and using that  i developed and using that i made sure that i'm learning new topicsi made sure that i'm learning new topics  i made sure that i'm learning new topicsi learned dynamic programmingprogramming  programming so all this happened just because i wasso all this happened just because i was  so all this happened just because i was doing contestsdoing contests  which means solving those problems which you weresolving those problems which you were  solving those problems which you were not able to solvenot able to solve  not able to solve during the contest and doing that forduring the contest and doing that for  during the contest and doing that for six monthssix months  six monthsgetting a world rank of 25 in such agetting a world rank of 25 in such a  getting a world rank of 25 in such a short amount of time was ashort amount of time was a  short amount of time was a very huge deal for meso  when you see such great results so that's exactly what i want toemphasizethat's exactly what i want to emphasize  that's exactly what i want to emphasize uponupon  uponyou should definitely be doing hard workyou should definitely be doing hard work  you should definitely be doing hard work but also do those things correctlybut also do those things correctly  but also do those things correctly solve those problems which you are notsolve those problems which you are not  solve those problems which you are not able to solve in the first placeable to solve in the first place  able to solve in the first place and doing that like i am pretty muchand doing thatlike i am pretty much  and doing that like i am pretty much sure that if you do it for a period ofsure that if you do it for a period of  sure that if you do it for a period of three or four monthsthree or four months  three or four months the results will be incredible guys     the other good thing which worked to mythe other good thing which worked to my  the other good thing which worked to my advantageso many things because you didn't know so many thingsbecauseso it's very easy for you to learn in the initial periodthe initial period  the initial perioddon't feel that we don't know solikedon't feel that we don't know so  like don't feel that we don't know so many things think aboutitmany things think about it  many things think about it you can learn so many things in such ayou can learn so many things in such a  you can learn so many things in such a short amount of timeshort amount of time  short amount of time now after six monthsafter six months i decided to also  now after six months i decided to also switch to code forcesswitch to code forces  switch to code forces on which there are many short contestson which there are many short contests  on which there are many short contests which are held likewhich are held like  which are held like like a contest on code forces would havelike a contest on code forces would have  like a contest on code forces would have four or five problemsfour or five problems  four or five problems and you will be asked to solve themi realized that oh  so in this situation i realized that oh my god i am a terrible problemforthe courtship long challenges were for  the courtship long challenges were for 10 daysso much amount of time and one thing which i have realized isand one thing which i have realized is  and one thing which i have realized is that when you are uncomfortablethat when you are uncomfortable  that when you are uncomfortable solving some problem you tend tosolving some problem you tend to  solving some problem you tend to postpone it or get away with itand that's exactly what i used to do like when i'm giving a code for thislike when i'm giving a code for this  like when i'm giving a code for this problemand i'm trying to solve a problem whichproblem which  problem which is kind of tricky to solve for me iis kind of tricky to solve for meyou know what i'm trying to saytrying to say  trying to say like my mind was trainedto postponelike my mind was trained to postpone  like my mind was trained to postpone things where i'm feeling uncomfortablethings where i'm feeling uncomfortable  things where i'm feeling uncomfortable and probably pick them up later when i'mand probably pick them up later when i'm  and probably pick them up later when i'm having a walk or in my leisure time sohaving a walk or in my leisure timethat's the attitude which i developed whilewhile  while doing the courtship long challengesdoing the courtship long challenges  doing the courtship long challenges because they were for 10 days long so ibecauseso i couldcould  could deal with them like very easily in adeal with them like very easily in a  deal with them like very easily in a very comfortable amount of timevery comfortable amount of time  very comfortable amount of timebut this is where code forces completely turned the picture like iturned the picture like i  turned the picture like i did really very bad in the initial fewdid really very bad in the initial few  did really very bad in the initial few contests just because i was gettingcontests just because i was getting  contests just because i was getting accustomed to the portal as well asaccustomed to the portal as well as  accustomed to the portal as well as the new like the faster way of solvingthe new like the faster way of solving  the new like the faster way of solving problems which i was really not good atproblems which i was really not good at  problems which i was really not good at at that point of timeat that point of time  at that point of timebut i was not quick enough that's what i'm trying to sayi'm trying to say  i'm trying to sayand that's some skill which really took me a lot of time to develop over theme a lot of time to develop over the  me a lot of time to develop over the period of timeperiod of time  period of timeand that's where code forces helped meandand that's where code forces helped me really a lot     so i kept on giving contests they were always ups and downs in few contests i'malways ups and downs in few contestsi'm doing really good in some contests i'mdoing really good in some contestsi'm  doing really good in some contestsi'm making the mistakes the ones which i just mentioned few minutesones which i just mentioned few minutes  ones which i just mentioned few minutes backback  back so overall this continued for a periodso overallthis continued for a period  so overall this continued for a period of around 10of around 10  of around 10 11 months or one yeari reached that  so in these 18 months i reached that point where i was super confident aboutpoint where i was super confident about  point where i was super confident about my data structure and algorithm skills imy data structure and algorithm skillsi knew why my approach is right or why isknew why my approach is right or why is  knew why my approach is right or why is it wrongit wrong  it wrongand i only started writing the code when i was sure that this is correctii was sure that this is correct and more importantly having the skill isand more importantly having the skill is  and more importantly having the skill is good but more important in that isgood but more important ini was really very quick in navigating the multiple solutions and also pickingthe multiple solutions and also picking  the multiple solutions and also picking up the most optimized one which is atup the most optimized one which is at  up the most optimized one which is at the same timeright we don't want optimized solutionsrightwe don't want optimized solutions  right we don't want optimized solutions which are wrong sowhich are wrongso  which are wrong so developing the skill to think aboutdeveloping the skill to think about  developing the skill to think about multiple solutions figure out which onemultiple solutions figure out which one  multiple solutions figure outis right which one is wrong and why it's wrong having all thoseand why it's wrong having all those  and why it's wrong having all those things in mind and doing thatthings in mind and doing that  things in mind and doing that quickly is a very important skillwhichquickly is a very important skill which  quickly is a very important skill which took me around 18 months totook me around 18 months to  took me around 18 months to really be good at itit's not just you are able to solve ortoi'm talking aboutabout  about doing that consistently like doing thatdoing that consistently like doing that  doing that consistently like doing that contest after contestso i reached that skillskill  skill in around 18 months also at that pointin around 18 months also at that point  in around 18 months also at that point of timeconvert my thoughts into code and that code is not havinginto code and that code is not having  into code and that code is not having bugs even if it has bugs i wasbugs even if it has bugsi was very easily able to figure out why thatvery easily able to figure out why that  very easily able to figure out why that code has works andcodehas works and  code has works and this thing really helps me even now as athis thing really helps me even now as a  this thing really helps me even now as a software engineersoftware engineer  software engineerit comes naturally for me now to analyze and figure outand figure out  and figure out where the problem is now again thanks towherethe problem is now again thanks to  where the problem is now again thanks to educative.io for sponsoring this videoeducative.io for sponsoring this

code forces as well asforces as well as  forces as well as at that point of timethis is how my journey looked like  uh this is how my journey looked like but one thing which i want to stressbut one thing which i want to stress  but one thing which i want to stress over here isover herewe all have  different people of course we all have different abilities todifferent abilities to  different abilities to absorb things and at the same time weabsorb things and at the same time we  absorb things and at the same time we are doing a whole bunch of differentare doing a whole bunch of different  are doing a whole bunch of different thingsthatwhole bunch of different problems that  whole bunch of different problems that we need to tackle in our liveswe need to tackle in our lives  so everyone's journey would be different of course and 18 months is not that likeof course and 18 months is not that like  of course and 18 months is not that like it's a benchmark that if you're laterit's a benchmark that if you're later  it's a benchmark that if you're later than that then you're stupidthanit's nothing like that i'm just giving a sense ofi'mjust giving a sense of  i'm just giving a sense of generally or a rough idea of how long itgenerally or a rough idea of how long it  generally or a rough idea of how long it takes to be really good at somethingtakes to be really good at something  takes to be really good at something that's itso probably it inspires you as well thatwell that  well that you should consistently practice foryouyou should consistently practice for that manythat many  that many months and only then decide whether youmonths and only then decide whether you  months and only then decide whether you are stupid or not all righti have seen a lot of people get demotivated justa lot of people get demotivated just  a lot of people get demotivated just because they are not seeing results butbecause they are not seeing resultsbut  because they are not seeing results but it takes time and patience18 months i didn't get anything in backanything in back  anything in back even after contest after contesti felteven after contest after contest i felt  even after contest after contest i felt good about learninggood about learning  good about learning thingsand that's where my focus always lie whether i'm learning somethingwhether i'm learning
